# Introduction
Data Science is a rapidly growing field, and Data Scientists play an important and crucial role in analyzing and interpreting large amounts of data. As this profession becomes increasingly in demand, it is important to understand the factors that may influence Data Scientist's salaries.

# Objective
The aim of this analysis was led by my own questions, and with an overall objective to look more into the factors that influence the salaries of Data Scientists, and mainly focus on understanding the relationship between the variables and their impact on salaries, and identifying trends and patterns, using numbers and statistics.

# Data
This data has been sourced from Kaggle and the data set contains a single table with the following columns which were used for the analysis:

1. work_year: The year in which the data was recorded.
2. job_title: The specific title of the job role, like 'Data Scientist', 'Data Engineer', or 'Data Analyst'.
3. job_category: A classification of the job role into broader categories for easier analysis.
4. salary_currency: The currency in which the salary is paid, such as USS and EUR.
5. salary: The annual gross salary of the role in the local currency.

12. company_size: The size of the employer company, often categorized into small (S), medium (M), and large (L) sizes.

# Analysis Tools
Analysis has been conducted using Jupyter Notebooks and the Anaconda libraries manager, Python and relevant libraries such as pandas, NumPy, os were used for analysis purpose and seaborn, matplotlib, Folium and scikit-learn were used for visualization.

# Visualization
Visualizations for this data have been created in Python and Tableau, and a data storyboard was created in Tableau and the link to the storyboard can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/saranya.prabhakar/viz/JobsSalariesinDataScience/Story1
